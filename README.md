# fullstack-2020-resources

## Usage
Use this repo to collect and structure resources from
- information from lectures
- external resources
- related material and references
- anything else you think your classmates might find valuable

## Collaboration
You are free to collaborate and structure resources in any way you want but keep in mind that you have to do it together and think of this as an exercise to build a valueble resource for everyone in the class. 

### Suggesting resources and structure
- Please use issues and pull requests using the [project](https://github.com/bjornwann/fullstack-2020-resources/projects/1) when you submit them so you can track them in the project. 
- Have at least one person to review your pull requests (preferably not bjornwann)
- Structure resources in markdown files and try to have different files for different subjects, however this structure might have to change during the process so try to not do too many changes in a single commit
- use branches for larger structural changes and have several people review them before commiting
- TIP: clone the repo and branch it and use VS-code to do larger commits to several files
